# ANN for Classification and regression: Project Overview


### Classification: used deep learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck

### Regression: used deep learning to create a model that predicts sales prices of houses

## Worthwile to mention
* Created a project that summarizes some basic techniques both for classification and regression
* Clearly highlighted workflow stages of a Machine learning project:
  1. Define problem statement
  2. Importing/Collecting data
  3. EDA analysis
  4. Data preprocessing
  5. Build, train, evaluate models
  6. Tune model and make predictions
* Used artificial neural networks  


## Code and Resources Used
* **Python version**: 3.9
* **Packages**: pandas, numpy, sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn, tensorflow
* **Data source**: classification: (https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data), regression: (https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data)
* **Helped by Github**: (https://github.com/mrdbourke/tensorflow-deep-learning)
   
## Model performance
### Classification: accuracy=83% (on predicting if the passenger survived or not)
### Regression: MAE=13464 (median value of saleprices is 163.000 dollars and ours deviation is 13.456 dollars )
