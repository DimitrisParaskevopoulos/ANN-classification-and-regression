# ANN for Classification and Regression: Project Overview


### Classification: Deep Learning models that predict which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck

### Regression: Deep Learning models that predict sales prices of houses

## Key Features
* Highlighted the workflow stages of a Machine Learning project:
  1. Define problem statement
  2. Importing/collecting data
  3. EDA analysis
  4. Data preprocessing
  5. Build, train, evaluate models
  6. Tune model
  7. Make predictions

## Models performance
### Classification: accuracy=83%
### Regression: MAE=13.464
